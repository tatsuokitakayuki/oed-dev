# OED - Open, edit, and download.

## What is this
"OED" is a text / code editor implemented only in web technology.
"OED" is the Progressive Web Apps (PWA).
We make "OED" mainly for Chromebook (or Chromium OS and OS based) users.

## Goal
- Turn "OED" into a worthy text editor.
    - Add features.
        1. Make all Ace features as accessible as possible.
            - Immediate priority goals.
        2. Implement functions to be provided as PWA.
        3. Implements functions unique to "OED".
    - Correct the bug.
    - Prepare source code.

## Features of "OED"
- A complete progressive web app (PWA). Perhaps.
    - We are not using the Chrome API.
    - Usability differs from a general text editor.
        - For example, there is no "Save file". Instead, there is a "Download file".
- Cache all files needed to run the app in local storage.
    - Works offline. Perhaps.
- Updates automatically in the background.
    - Always keep the latest version.
        - The dev channel sometimes releases with bugs.
- We use material design.
    - Most web apps that come pre-installed with Chrome OS use material design.
    - We have no idea why we can adopt other designs in this app.
    - And above all, we wanted to use material design.
        - You can't measure the good or bad without actually using it.
- No special permissions are required.
    - To prevent unnecessary access to browsers, operating systems, and hardware.
- No cookies.
    - We use IndexedDB instead.
- Open source software.
    - Open source software.
